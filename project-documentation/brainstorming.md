## App Concept: TVShow Logger 

TVShow Logger is a social tracking app that allows users to log, rate, and discover TV shows they watch, while also exploring what other users are watching. 

## MVP functionality: 

### Minimal goals: 
- Can create user (sign up/ login/sign out) 
- Display user profile 
- Users can “log” tvshows to their diary 
- Protected endpoints (you have to log in to see other endpoints than login page) 
- Search bar for tv shows 

### Standard goals: 
- Admin flag for users 
- Admins can manage the “official” tv show database / reference 
- Data persisted in a postgreSQL database 

### Bonus goals: 

- Users can add eachother and see other “friends” profiles 
- Users can add TVshows to their “watchlist”
